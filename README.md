DogClinic Sample Databases Project
==================================

This is a simple project created during the classes of an undergraduate Databases course,
intended to teach the students by example how to create a Java project that uses JDBC, JPA
and JAXB. It's quick, dirty and full of TODOs, but its sole purpose is to illustrate basic
concepts without providing too much material so the students can't copypaste everything
and call it a day. It has been developed with the Eclipse IDE.

It shouldn't be used as teaching material by itself, only as a companion to my classes.
